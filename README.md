# canoe-design - Python code to help design and refine canoe shapes

This code was written in order to create the design for ["Fran"](fran), a 14.5' solo canoe for an [extended trip on the Northern Forest Canoe Trail](http://zimeon.com/2018/06/nfct). It reads and writes a set of station plans and other information in a format similar to that in the Canoecraft book. There are very rudimentary facilities to edit that station sections with keyboard commands. It also has the ability to write out a set of PDF files for the stations designed to be printed on multiple sheets of 11x17" paper and then used for cutting. 

This code likely will not be developed further until/unless I build another canoe.

## Limitations

  * Lots...
  * Very little documentation, one has to look at the code
  * The fairing code is not sufficiently robust
  * Code at the moment assumes that the total length is from end to end of the sheer line -- this isn't right for a traditional curved-back canoe end (but I don't like them...)
