If we use _Lp_ and _Wp_ for position and weight of the person, with similar symbols for buoyancy (b), canoe weight (c), and pack (p). Then for balance:

_Lb_ * _Wb_ = _La_ * _Wa_ + _Lc_ * _Wc_ + _Lp_ * _Wp_

where we assume that the canoe is floating and hence:

_Wb_ = _Wa_ + _Wc_ + _Wp_

where provided all distances are measured from the same point it doesn't matter where that point is. I've picked the stern.

_Lb_ and _Lc_ might be slightly different if the canoe is not symmetric. In the 14'6" Fran with 260lbs we expect _Lb_ ~ 82" and _Lc_ ~ 87"
